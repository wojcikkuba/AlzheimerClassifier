# AlzheimerClassifier
Python project for classification of Alzheimer's disease using SVM

The classifier uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease or not
based on various features extracted from clincal data, such as the volume of different brain regions and clinical dementia rating.

Added simple Flask interface for easy to use GUI. To run the Flask interface, make sure to install the Flask package and run the **`app.py`** file.

# Requirements
To run the classifier, you will need Python 3.x and the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- Flask
